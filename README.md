# Feed Them Up!

**Feed Them Up!** is a 2D shooter game that introduces an innovative energy management mechanic, combining fast-paced action with a unique survival twist. Players must shoot enemies and survive through waves while managing their energy levels. In a world where **bullets are food**, players face the constant challenge of balancing starvation and overeating as they battle through relentless enemy waves.

## Features

- **Randomized Levels**: Each playthrough is unique with procedurally generated levels, offering fresh challenges every time.

## Game Overview

The player and enemies can dodge or absorb bullets, but too much consumption leads to energy overload, and too little results in starvation. The player's goal is to manage this balance while eliminating all enemies to survive through the end.
